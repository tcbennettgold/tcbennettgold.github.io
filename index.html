UTAs are discrete events that occur at a specific time and specific location, and use of GIS in spatial and temporal analysis of these events has become integral in the field of transportation engineering. Although human error is a predominant factor in nearly all UTAs, GIS tools allow for the layering of complex information that can offer insight into spatial and temporal relationships and patterns that influence the frequency and severity of UTAs. Analysis of spatial relationships and UTA frequency can support the identification of &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; which have an elevated likelihood of generated future UTAs, and the treatment of which can address UTAs proactively. Temporal aggregation is able to offer insight, however is problematic in that the level of detail required for effective analysis is substantially greater than other methods. GIS applications allow for sophisticated spatial statistical analysis, such as cluster analysis in one- or two-dimension, however care must be taken to account for spatial autocorrelation. Care must also be taken when comparing roadway segments and their relationship with UTA frequencies to avoid conclusions related to roadway characteristics more so than to risk of UTA occurrence; one method is to divide segments into homogeneous partitions, another is to use a uniform &ldquo;sliding window&rdquo; to capture high and low value UTA frequencies. Once adjusted for spatial autocorrelation, sliding windows or uniform segments can be analyzed with a standard suite of statistical tools such as multivariate regression analysis to associate roadway characteristics with UTA frequency. Statistical models for UTAs have been found to fit well for poisson distributed models, though overdispersion is also common, in which case negative binomial models perform well. Identification of hazardous locations can be based on either absolute frequency of UTAs, or can be adjusted for exposure (e.g. crashes occurring in an intersection, or crashes occurring per million entering vehicles at an intersection); adjusting for exposure can be done by pairing traffic volume data or other metric of exposure to the other underlying datasets of UTA characteristics and roadway characteristics.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Alkhadour, Wesam, et al. &ldquo;Traffic Accidents Detection Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications</span><span class="c4">, vol. 12, no. 4, The Science and Information Organization, 2021, </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2021.0120462&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753385950&amp;usg=AOvVaw0M2fyDXyUGHn9EUm5404_F">https://doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2021.0120462</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">The Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI) is used in a GIS environment to identify traffic crash hotspots, which are in turn analyzed to garner an increased understanding of spatial factors which influence crash risk. Amman, Jordan is used as a case study for this methodology, a city which has experienced dramatic growth, and dramatic increase in crash fatalities, in recent decades. Over 60% of crash fatalities in Amman are pedestrian crash victims, possible a result of heavily mixed mode environments and mixed infrastructure development likely to be present in rapidly developing cities. GIS-based crash analysis is an improvement over previously used tabular based systems because they allow full use of spatial information inherent in the data and dramatically reduce analysis complexity inherent in spatial analysis with tabular data alone. SQL querying was used in conjunction with spatial analysis tools to help incorporate temporal factors into the analysis. Statistically significant spatial clustering was evident from the results of the analysis, highlighting a preponderance of areas city-wide which expressed an elevated risk of crashes, or elevated crash severity. These hotspots were concentrated in centrally located zones where density is high and speed limits are low. A barrier to improving quality of analysis was low-quality location data, which could be improved if crash reporting were enabled to use GPS location devices to more precisely identify crash locations.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Bassani, M., et al. &ldquo;3D GIS BASED EVALUATION OF THE AVAILABLE SIGHT DISTANCE TO ASSESS SAFETY OF URBAN ROADS.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences</span><span class="c4">, vol.

ASD is compared to the distance a driver would travel before coming to a stop or completing a maneuver; if ASD is not sufficient then the driver may encounter objects or vehicles beyond their available sight distance which they are unable to react to before entering into a conflict and risking a crash. ASD is a ubiquitous consideration of modern roadway design, but many existing roadways were constructed before careful consideration of ASD was commonplace. GIS can be employed to model sight distance obstructions (roadway geometry, or roadside features) using digital surface models (DSM) which can aid in modeling a driver&rsquo;s sightlines and calculating ASD. A case study evaluating roads in Turin, Italy, where a DSM was created based on aerial images and vehicle-based stereoscopic imaging. A model of 5 m resolution was found to be inadequate for assessing ASD, but a model with 10 cm resolution was found to be sufficient for the purposes of assessing ASD continuously along a roadway. While the process for assessing ASD is not complicated, producing a DSM adequate to the purpose required a carefully refined algorithm to ensure that partially hidden entities which could nonetheless affect ASD were accounted for. The completed algorithm generated a point-cloud of triple-verified points (from different camera angles in the vehicle-based detection) and utilized data capable of being collected with only a pair of vehicle-mounted smartphones. Use of similar methods can be used not only to evaluate ASD on existing roads predating contemporary engineering standards, but also to continuously evaluate the evolving urban cityscape where the traffic environment undergoes constant change.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Chen, Huayun. &ldquo;Black Spot Determination of Traffic Accident Locations and Its Spatial Association Characteristic Analysis Based on GIS.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Journal of Geographic Information System</span><span class="c4">, vol. 04, no. 06, Scientific Research Publishing, Inc., 2012, pp. 608&ndash;17. </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.4236/jgis.2012.46063&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753387512&amp;usg=AOvVaw13C6V2Z8fO2ewAap4Dbvsp">https://doi.org/10.4236/jgis.2012.46063</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>[</span><span class="c6">Ed: This paper is from 2012, and refers to research on &ldquo;traffic accident information systems based on GIS&rdquo; as being &ldquo;in its infancy&rdquo;.

Geocoding is a process which can extract spatial information from address-as-text, allowing the rich dataset of crash-specific information to be geolocated and analyzed using GIS tools. Alternatively or in addition to geocoding, crash reporting systems can be made to include GPS data enhanced with Virtual Reference Station (VRS) networks to allow crash location recording with a high degree of accuracy and precision. For geocoding, the process is composed of two steps, first address parsing, and second address matching. Address parsing faces the difficulties of nonstandard naming conventions (as well as the introduction of human error both in the initial recording as well as in data entry). Standardization of addressing would greatly reduce the risk of data error or geocoding error. When successful, address parsing can extract from address-as-text address elements which can then be used in address matching to identify a crash location in the form of intersection and offset (i.e. the distance from a nearby intersection. The intersection and offset information can then locate the point spatial in conventional coordinate systems through linear references along a roadway network with identified intersection points and linear routes. Crashes occurring at intersections and crashes occurring away from intersections vary dramatically in causal characteristics. Crashes which occur within proximity to an intersection may or may not be causally related to their proximity to the intersection (e.g. a run-off-the-road crash can occur anyway, even near an intersection, while a left-turn crash which occurs near an intersection is fundamentally different than a left-turn crash which occurs away from an intersection). Whether a crash is assessed as being intersection-related or not should be identified as a fundamental crash characteristic, and crash risk for intersections can be analyzed separately from crash risk for street segments. &ldquo;Black spot&rdquo; identification is the process of identifying accident-intensive roadway segments and intersections. Criteria for identifying black spots varies between organizations and agencies, but typical methodologies include: crash frequency or crash rate above a threshold, high potential for reduction of crash frequency or rate. Black spot analysis can be used to prioritize projects based on expected safety benefit.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Dai, Dajun, and Derek Jaworski. &ldquo;Influence of Built Environment on Pedestrian Crashes: A Network-based GIS Analysis.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Applied Geography</span><span class="c4">, vol. 73, Elsevier BV, Aug. 2016, pp. 53&ndash;61. </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.06.005&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753388514&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DbhqBp_O7soZUTmvJUb90">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.06.005</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Pedestrian crashes in DeKalb County, Georgia, USA, were analyzed using a network-based kernel density methodology to identify hotspots for pedestrian crashes; after hotspot analysis was completed additional qualitative analysis was done by field study. The intent of the analysis was to gain insight into the relative importance of features affecting pedestrian crash risk. Features considered as factors in analysis included marked crosswalks, signalized crosswalks, raised medias, and pedestrian refuge islands, and others. GIS tools were used to reproduce built-environment features in the vicinity of hotspots. Predictably, areas which attract high pedestrian volumes also had higher pedestrian crash frequency (exposure was not controlled for; high-quality pedestrian volume data, especially longitudinal data, is difficult to collect without great cost and foresight), and as a result hotspots tended to occur at transit stops, high-density residential areas, and dense commercial districts with predominantly stores and restaurants.The study was unable to find significant differences in crash which were attributable to elements of the built environment, and instead found that factors which are likely to be associated with higher pedestrian volumes were overwhelming indicative of higher crash frequency. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c7 c15"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Durduran, S.

Delaware Dept. of Transportation (DelDOT) identified two primary shortcomings of existing available GIS systems: 1) Poor formatting compatibility between different systems, and 2) Very limited ability to link multiple databases. DelDOT developed an in-house GIS system which addressed these and other limitations of existing software options. The DelDOT INTERGRAPH system pulls together basemaps, roadway network data, individual crash data, as well as data for other features of interest. In addition to graphical display of roadway networks and crash locations, the INTERGRAPH system allows for querying by date range and linear reference bounds along a specified route, as well as dynamic segmentation of routes, and summary statistics for route segments. DelDOT also identified challenges in developing future GIS systems, such as database management for increasingly complex data sets, continued issues with standardization between competing software products, and cultivated trained GIS users.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Kotikov, Jurij. &ldquo;GIS-Modeling of Multimodal Complex Road Network and Its Traffic Organization.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Transportation Research Procedia</span><span class="c4">, vol. 20, Elsevier BV, 2017, pp. 340&ndash;46. </span><span class="c4 c11"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2017.01.043&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753391111&amp;usg=AOvVaw28hfyZV-Cvo2r4oOZBHjR6">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2017.01.043</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Port areas represent a level of network complexity and traffic mixing not found in typical traffic environments, and are poorly served by modeling techniques employed to analyze the wider transportation network.

A geodatabase containing the disparate datasets for spatial objects, roadways, rail, sea routes, and other traffic facilities was created for the purpose of gestalt network analysis, and prospective facilities were included as well. Three-dimensional modeling was employed to accommodate multilevel facilities and multilevel access to destination buildings, as well as signage or other features which pertain to one level or another (a distinction which would be lost in two-dimensional representation), and also to represent three-dimensional characteristics of junctions or non-intersecting crossroads.

Las Vegas, Nevada, serves as a case study for a GIS-based Safety Analysis System developed using ESRI&rsquo;s ArcGIS software. A GIS environment is a natural platform for crash safety analysis due to its ability to integrate diverse data sets as well as visualize and analyze spatial data. ESRI ArcGIS was selected for this case study due to its current use by agencies in the Las Vega metropolitan area. Crash data was obtained from the Nevada Department of Transportation, and centerline street data was obtained from the Clark County GIS Management Office. System architecture design was divided into macro and micro levels of examination; macro levels are to provide information at City scale, and micro levels are to provide information at the roadway-segment or intersection scale. VBA programming tools were built to perform analysis at these levels and output results as a Microsoft Excel document as well as displaying results graphically in ArcGIS ArcMap. Roadway segment and intersection analysis are performed separately. Challenges encountered included: numerous misspelled database entries (e.g. street names), and shifting dependencies related to version changes in the software suite. Recommendations for future improvements to the system include: more precise location information from crash reporting (e.g. GPS location rather than address or milepost), and incorporate a larger corpus of roadway and traffic characteristics.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Marshall, Wesley Earl, and Norman W.

In aggregate, crash rates are higher in the US than in other developed countries, and rather than assess micro-scale causes such as roadway segment characteristics, crash frequency was instead modeled as a function of network design characteristics, with factors such as network density, neighborhood through-traffic opportunities, or overall network connectivity. The methodology was applied to 24 cities in the US of varying traffic safety performance. Model inputs were the product of geocoding crash data from lat / long coordinates, or intersection-offset format, and of spatial analysis of street network data in ESRI ArcGIS to computer summary statistics representing connectivity, compactness, and pattern. Connectivity was modeled as a link-to-node ratio (i.e. the number of between-intersection segments divided by the number of intersections). Network density was modeled as the number of intersections per square mile. Network pattern was assigned as one of four factor levels for city-wide network (Linear, Tributary, Radial, or Grid), and one of two levels for neighborhood street network (Grid or Tree); it was found that this classification of street network pattern was sufficient for describing all networks included in the study, however, it was limited in its ability to definitively classify curvilinear streets, and so an additional binary variable was included to denote whether a network was highly curvilinear or not. Pattern variables were classified manually, and other network characteristics were calculated using spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS. Lastly, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) was included as a measure of crash risk exposure. The completed analysis showed that crash frequency per VMT was significantly negatively correlated with intersection density, but significantly positively correlated to link to node ratio; these results were consistent across all levels of crash severity. Network pattern was found not to be a significant predictor of crash frequency per VMT.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Mitra, Sudeshna. &ldquo;Enhancing Road Traffic Safety&#8239;: A GIS Based Methodology to Identify Potential Areas of Improvement.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">University Transportation Centers US Transportation Collection</span><span class="c7 c4">, 681772058, Leonard Transportation Center, 2009, rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/18096#tabs-2.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">The major goal of a transportation system is to enhance mobility, and crashes are an unwanted byproduct of the system. Individual road users place a high priority on reduced travel time, which competes with the importance of addressing the societal cost of crashes. Many systems are in use which use spatial analysis to assess crash statistics, but of important consideration is the spatial dependence of crash data and of other characteristics of the traffic environment; crash data and other traffic characteristics have a high degree of spatial autocorrelation which must be addressed as part of any rigorous analysis. Accounting for autocorrelation will aid in detecting statistically significant clusters of crashes, those clusters can then be modeled as functions of roadway characteristics and socioeconomic factors in the vicinity. While Empirical Bayes methods are universally recognized in the field of traffic safety research as the superior method for identifying high-crash locations, the addition of GIS techniques allows spatial characteristics to be incorporated in the analysis of crash causes, as well as providing an invaluable visual medium for displaying data and analysis. Once crash clusters are plotted on a roadway network and accompanying basemap, subjective observation can lend further insight to location significance, such as proximity to schools or bars, areas of high travel density of alternate modes (bike, ped), or other factors which may benefit the analysis.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Qiaojun, Xiang, et al. &ldquo;GIS-Based Traffic Safety Management for Highway Intersections.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Transportation and Development Innovative Best Practices 2008</span><span class="c4">, American Society of Civil Engineers, Apr. 2008, </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1061/40961(319)33&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753394179&amp;usg=AOvVaw245uKqJVzwIY0L8tT6PZfw">https://doi.org/10.1061/40961(319)33</a></span><span class="c4 c7">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">A novel GIS-based system was developed which can be used to analyze intersections, determine safety level-of-service (an A through F grade for safety performance), identify intersection safety deficiencies, and recommend countermeasures prioritized by expected cost-benefit. A GIS environment was selected for this analysis for the benefits of dynamic data display, presentation of spatial relationships, and the addition of spatial query to the possible query criteria. This tool was developed for use in China, which, like many developing countries, often lacks complete crash history for intersections, even for a two or three year period, which makes safety evaluation predicated on crash history imprecise and unreliable. Instead of traditional crash records, this methodology identifies points of possible conflict (e.g. where opposing vehicle paths cross, or where a turn merges into an opposing lane) and weights those conflict points by the severity of crashes possible and by mitigating factors (such as advanced warning signing). Conflict points and mitigating factors for bicycle and pedestrian traffic are included as well. Site specific data is collected in the field to create a GIS database of intersection points with conflict-point data, and aggregated conflict hazard can be summarized for each intersection, and an algorithm can recommend safety improvements with remove conflict points or introduce beneficial mitigations to conflict points. This methodology has the advantage of achieving very quick and easy analysis once data collection is complete, and of producing actionable and consistent recommendations for safety improvement without the need for longitudinal data collection.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Rahman, Muhammad Tauhidur, et al. &ldquo;Examining Hotspots of Traffic Collisions and Their Spatial Relationships With Land Use: A GIS-Based Geographically Weighted Regression Approach for Dammam, Saudi Arabia.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information</span><span class="c4">, vol. 9, no. 9, MDPI AG, Sept. 2020, p. 540. </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9090540&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753394968&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Mij3R89RUdBxGN-yH92Wn">https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9090540</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span>Dammam, Saudi Arabia, was selected as a case study for evaluating the relationship between land use and traffic crashes. The cost of crashes in Saudi Arabia amounts to 4.3% of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s gross domestic product each year, generally attributed to factors such as distracted driving, speeding, and non-compliance with traffic control devices or traffic regulations. &ldquo;Hot spot&rdquo; identification seeks to identify times and locations where crashes occur more frequently. Typically crash rates or frequencies are modeled as a function of traffic characteristics such as traffic flow or roadway geometry, and this methodology is widely acknowledged as useful for identifying locations where there is potential for safety improvement. The relationship between hotspots and land use in Dammam is intended to offer insight into the effect of changing land use on future shifts in traffic safety. Different land use attracts different types and frequencies of trips, which may have an effect of traffic safety (crash frequency as well as crash severity) outside of what can be learned from analysis of the roadway and traffic characteristics typically modeled. A negative binomial model for crash frequency demonstrated that in Dammam there were significantly higher crash frequencies in areas with urban residential, business and commercial, and mixed residential commercial land uses; generally speaking, as land use intensified, severe crash frequency increased. Additionally, pedestrian crash frequency and severity was found to be inversely related to high density of complete sidewalks, steep grade, high industrial land use, lower speed limits, and fewer bus stops. [</span><span class="c6">Ed: It&rsquo;s worth noting that this study did not control for exposure -- many of these factors which were shown to increase crash frequency are almost certainly also increasing exposure, and likewise factors which reduce exposure would reduce opportunities for crashes to happen. E.g. fewer pedestrian crashes where fewer bus stops are present follow logically -- buses serve pedestrians almost exclusively, and areas without bus stops are much more difficult to access by pedestrians. That&rsquo;s not to say the study is without merit; knowing which locations will have frequent crashes can help identify opportunities to address those crashes, regardless of cause. The risk however is coming to a poor conclusion such as &ldquo;get rid of bus stops to protect pedestrians&rdquo;, which, unfortunately, this paper does little to guard against. </span><span class="c1">]</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Ture Kibar, Funda, and Hediye Tuydes-Yaman. &ldquo;GIS-based Evaluation of the Speed Limit Increase on Urban Arterial Traffic Safety in Ankara.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Arabian Journal of Geosciences</span><span class="c4">, vol. 13, no. 12, Springer Science and Business Media LLC, June 2020, </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05486-5&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753395929&amp;usg=AOvVaw1u6abYsnxBwnL9tzPerXl9">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05486-5</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Speed-limit setting is a complex and difficult task even in developed countries with robust and mature traffic infrastructure, and speed-limit setting in developing countries undergoing rapid growth and mixed purpose roadway networks is a near insurmountable challenge. The effects of compliance with a speed limit are primarily characterized by variation in travel speed mean speed of travel. A lower speed limit may result in lower mean travel speeds, but suffer lower compliance and thus greater variation in travel speeds. A higher speed limit may result in less speed variation but also higher mean speed. Higher variation in travel speed and higher mean speed of travel are both factors which increase risk of crashes. Other characteristics of traffic operations are affected as well, but the effect on safety is of primary concern here. Spatiotemporal analysis of travel speeds statistics in a GIS environment and using nearest-neighbor hierarchical clustering for crashes was used in a case study of 7 urban arterials in Ankara, Turkey where speed limit changes were introduced. In the study areas, speed limits were increased in order to solicit greater compliance and thus lower variation in travel speeds, though likely at the cost of increasing the mean speed of travel. Clustering analysis found 97 statistically significant clusters before speed limits were increased, and 101 clusters after speed limits were increased. A higher number of total crashes was found as well. Traffic volume data was not available, so the possibility for a change in exposure cannot be accounted for; this is a common challenge for traffic studies in developing countries. Crash data for fatal and injury crashes was geocoded (Property-damage-only crashes in this case are predominantly self-reported, and so comprise a lower-quality dataset). Data quality issues with location information resulted in a high-degree of scattering, and so crashes within a 400 m buffer of the roadway centerline were mapped to the nearest street alignment before GIS tools were used for the identification of crash clusters. A 3 year period was used for &ldquo;before&rdquo; data and also for the &ldquo;after&rdquo; data set.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Yu, Chia-Yuan. &ldquo;Environmental Supports for Walking/Biking and Traffic Safety: Income and Ethnicity Disparities.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Preventive Medicine</span><span class="c4">, vol. 67, Elsevier BV, Oct. 2014, pp. 12&ndash;16. </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.06.028&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753396747&amp;usg=AOvVaw1w195cPPqFuarvzx7bQE1f">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2014.06.028</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Active travel modes have innumerable health, economic, environmental, mobility, and societal benefits. Barriers to selecting an active travel mode are numerous, but among them traffic safety is a substantial deterrent to walking or biking as a mode choice. Austin, Texas, was selected for a novel study of the built environment and its effect on bicycle and pedestrian safety and mode participation. Austin was selected for its diverse range of development patterns, residential density, intersection density, income levels, ethnicity concentrations, and also because of the availability of high-quality GIS data sets available for land-use data, street data, and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure data. The crosssectional study used log-transformed walk-commute and bike-commute worker percentage as the two dependent variables. Poverty rate, percentage of white population, and percentage of Hispanic population were used as socioeconomic explanatory variables, along with a suite of characteristics describing the built environment and traffic safety. Cycling data and walking data were analyzed in separate models. Analysis yielded a high number of statistically significant factors, and several explanatory variables were also found to have high degrees of cross correlation. Several factors which had significant explanatory value for traffic safety also had significant explanatory value for increased rates of bicycle or pedestrian commuting, however, of particular interest were several factors which had significant negative correlation with traffic safety but positive correlation with walk or bike commute rates; these factors would be expected to increase bicycle and pedestrian exposure while also increasing bicycle and pedestrian crash risk. A limitation of this study was that bicycle and pedestrian travel was based on worker commuting mode choice, and thus is not guaranteed to be representative of active mode travel overall. Relatedly, because precise travel volumes for bicycle and pedestrian modes were not available, the crash frequency for bicycle and pedestrian modes was not controlled for exposure -- e.g. it is possible that higher rates of pedestrian crashes could be entirely explained by higher rates of pedestrian exposure.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Zhao, Xu, et al. &ldquo;A GIS-CA Model for Planning Bikeways Upon the Footpath Network.&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c6">Sustainability</span><span class="c4">, vol. 13, no. 16, MDPI AG, Aug. 2021, p. 8926. </span><span class="c11 c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168926&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1670039753397534&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jz1NPgEHoamiV5ljGq-QD">https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168926</a></span><span class="c7 c4">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Bicycle network planning is traditionally based on supply-side modeling (use of existing bicycle facilities) and demand-side modeling (specifically latent-demand, i.e. &ldquo;if you build it, they will come&rdquo;), but a gap in bicycle planning research is the use of existing alternate paths which are substandard for cycling or in competition with other modes (e.g. use of pedestrian paths). Cellular automata (CA) is a method useful for modeling self-propagating cellular values, making it useful for modeling &ldquo;living systems&rdquo; such as cyclists navigating ad-hoc paths through best-available infrastructure. Use of GIS-CA methods allows existing GIS assets for non-cycling infrastructure to be used to predict likely cycling use, as well as model potential cycling paths (or changes to cyclist pathfinding behavior) when additional bicycle infrastructure is developed. Combined supply side and demand side CA models can be developed to assist in planning of bicycle paths to find paths where minimal infrastructure investment can have the greatest impact on meeting latent demand as well as supporting existing bicycle infrastructure. The inputs to this model are 30 m cells with values for land use ranging from 0 (unavailable land) to 3 (existing path), values for cycling demand ranging from 0 (low or no demand) t to 2 (high demand), values for safety ranging from 0 (safe place) to 3 (high hazard place), and values for construction difficulty ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 2 (high difficulty). Model outputs for each cell are 0 (cell is not suitable), 1 (potential path), or 2 (ideal path). The CA model propagates based on the value of current and adjacent cells, and the resulting output is a raster of maximally suitable path generations. Several feasible paths may be generated, and introducing an iterative step to the CA model algorithm can assist with achieving paths with maximum suitability. Singapore was selected as a case study for the GIS-CA methodology to assist with planning of bicycle infrastructure, including locations of bike share nodes. While the algorithm was successful in identifying suitable paths, the most significant limitation to the process was found to be the large cell size (30 m); cell sizes with greater resolution introduce increased data collection costs but will have greater utility in bicycle path planning.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c16"></span></p></body></html>
